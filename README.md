# Online Resume Builder

The **Online Resume Builder** project allows users to create professional resumes with ease. After registering or logging in, users can choose from two available themes and fully customize their resume to their liking. The application offers features like adding custom sections, selecting fonts, background colors, and uploading profile images, with options to adjust their dimensions and borders. The final resume can be saved and downloaded in PDF format.

  - Adjust background color
  - Upload and modify profile images, including adjusting their height and border.
- **Download as PDF**: Once a resume is created, users can save and download it in PDF format.
